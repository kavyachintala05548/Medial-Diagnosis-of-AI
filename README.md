# Medial-Diagnosis-of-AI
## Overview
The **Medical Diagnosis of AI** is a machine learning-based healthcare application designed to assist in early disease detection by analyzing patient symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic data. The system leverages multiple machine learning models to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce human errors in medical assessments.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as **SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest**.
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis:** Processes patient symptoms to suggest possible diseases.
- **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Analysis:** Enhances diagnosis by incorporating patient history.
- **Streamlit Web Interface:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly frontend.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Hosted on cloud platforms for remote accessibility.
- **Scalable and Extensible:** Future scope includes integration with wearable devices and NLP-based medical note analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Streamlit)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Scikit-learn (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection:** Medical dataset containing symptoms and disease labels.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Feature selection, handling missing values, and normalization.
3. **Model Training:** Training ML models on patient data.
4. **Prediction Engine:** AI-driven analysis to detect diseases.
5. **User Interface:** Streamlit-based web application for easy interaction.
6. **Deployment:** Hosted on cloud for real-time medical predictions.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How to Use
1. Open the application in a browser.
2. Enter symptoms or medical history details.
3. Click "Predict" to get a probable diagnosis.
4. View the predicted disease and recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- **Expanded Disease Coverage**: Support for more medical conditions.
- **Wearable Device Integration**: Real-time health monitoring.
- **NLP Integration**: Analyze medical notes and patient history.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast disease progression based on past data.
- **Multilingual Support**: Improve accessibility for global users.
